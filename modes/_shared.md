# System Context -- career-ops

<!-- ============================================================
     THIS FILE IS AUTO-UPDATABLE. Don't put personal data here.
     
     Your customizations go in modes/_profile.md (never auto-updated).
     This file contains system rules, scoring logic, and tool config
     that improve with each career-ops release.
     ============================================================ -->

## Sources of Truth

| File | Path | When |
|------|------|------|
| cv.md | `cv.md` (project root) | ALWAYS |
| article-digest.md | `article-digest.md` (if exists) | ALWAYS (detailed proof points) |
| profile.yml | `config/profile.yml` | ALWAYS (candidate identity and targets) |
| _profile.md | `modes/_profile.md` (if exists) | ALWAYS — user overrides, wins over _shared.md |

**RULE: NEVER hardcode metrics from proof points.** Read them from cv.md + article-digest.md at evaluation time.
**RULE: For article/project metrics, article-digest.md takes precedence over cv.md.**
**RULE: Read _profile.md AFTER this file. User customizations in _profile.md override defaults here.**

## Scoring System

The evaluation uses 6 blocks (A-F) with a global score of 1-5:

| Dimension | What it measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Match con CV | Skills, experience, proof points alignment |
| North Star alignment | How well the role fits the user's target archetypes (from _profile.md) |
| Comp | Salary vs market (5=top quartile, 1=well below) |
| Cultural signals | Company culture, growth, stability, remote policy |
| Red flags | Blockers, warnings (negative adjustments) |
| **Global** | Weighted average of above |

**Score interpretation:**
- 4.5+ → Strong match, recommend applying immediately
- 4.0-4.4 → Good match, worth applying
- 3.5-3.9 → Decent but not ideal, apply only if specific reason
- Below 3.5 → Recommend against applying (see Ethical Use in CLAUDE.md)

| Archetype | Thematic axes | What they buy |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Head / VP of Product Design** | Design leadership, AI-integrated UX, design org scale | A design leader who ships AI products with revenue proof |
| **Head of AI Product** | AI product strategy, LLM-integrated flows, discovery to delivery | A founder who translates AI capabilities into measurable product outcomes |
| **Staff / Principal Design Engineer** | Design systems, React/TS, AI-augmented product engineering | A builder who straddles design and code at scale |
| **AI Transformation Lead** | Change management, AI adoption, org enablement, upskilling | Someone who led a team through AI transformation with hard metrics |
| **Applied AI / Founder-in-Residence** | Zero-to-one, prototyping, AI product launch, entrepreneurial | A founder who has proven PMF, acquisition, and cross-functional ownership |

## Posting Legitimacy (Block G)

Block G assesses whether a posting is likely a real, active opening. It does NOT affect the 1-5 global score -- it is a separate qualitative assessment.

**Three tiers:**
- **High Confidence** -- Real, active opening (most signals positive)
- **Proceed with Caution** -- Mixed signals, worth noting (some concerns)
- **Suspicious** -- Multiple ghost indicators, user should investigate first

**Key signals (weighted by reliability):**
| If the role is... | Emphasize about the candidate... | Proof point sources |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Head / VP of Product Design | Design org build (0→10), design system at scale, AI-literacy programs, retention, feature velocity | cv.md (Bark.com section) |
| Head of AI Product | CaseLab exit, Fetchd.ai launch, LLM product strategy, revenue impact from AI features | cv.md + article-digest.md |
| Staff / Principal Design Engineer | React/TS, design engineering, design systems at scale, shipped AI-integrated UX | cv.md (Bark + Workday + Intuit) |
| AI Transformation Lead | 25+ stakeholder alignment at Bark, AI literacy program, AI-first platform transformation, 63% YoY | cv.md (Bark.com leadership section) |
| Applied AI / Founder | CaseLab PMF + acquisition in 10 months, Fetchd.ai zero-to-one, cross-functional ownership | cv.md (Fetchd + CaseLab sections) |

| Signal | Source | Reliability | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Posting age | Page snapshot | High | Under 30d=good, 30-60d=mixed, 60d+=concerning (adjusted for role type) |
| Apply button active | Page snapshot | High | Direct observable fact |
| Tech specificity in JD | JD text | Medium | Generic JDs correlate with ghost postings but also with poor writing |
| Requirements realism | JD text | Medium | Contradictions are a strong signal, vagueness is weaker |
| Recent layoff news | WebSearch | Medium | Must consider department, timing, and company size |
| Reposting pattern | scan-history.tsv | Medium | Same role reposted 2+ times in 90 days is concerning |
| Salary transparency | JD text | Low | Jurisdiction-dependent, many legitimate reasons to omit |
| Role-company fit | Qualitative | Low | Subjective, use only as supporting signal |

**Ethical framing (MANDATORY):**
- This helps users prioritize time on real opportunities
- NEVER present findings as accusations of dishonesty
- Present signals and let the user decide
- Always note legitimate explanations for concerning signals

## Archetype Detection
Use the candidate's exit story from `config/profile.yml` to frame ALL content:
- **In PDF Summaries:** "Founded and exited an AI SaaS. Now applying the same founder + design + AI instincts to [JD domain]."
- **In STAR stories:** Lead with CaseLab/Fetchd as proof of end-to-end ownership — not just features, whole products.
- **In Draft Answers (Section G):** The founder-to-leader narrative should appear in the first response.
- **When the JD asks for "entrepreneurial", "ownership", "builder", "end-to-end", "zero-to-one":** This is the #1 differentiator. Increase match weight significantly — most design leaders lack founder credibility.
- **When the JD asks for "AI literacy", "AI transformation", "cross-functional AI":** Bark.com is the proof point — led org-wide AI transformation with hard revenue numbers.

Classify every offer into one of these types (or hybrid of 2):

| Archetype | Key signals in JD |
|-----------|-------------------|
| AI Platform / LLMOps | "observability", "evals", "pipelines", "monitoring", "reliability" |
| Agentic / Automation | "agent", "HITL", "orchestration", "workflow", "multi-agent" |
| Technical AI PM | "PRD", "roadmap", "discovery", "stakeholder", "product manager" |
| AI Solutions Architect | "architecture", "enterprise", "integration", "design", "systems" |
| AI Forward Deployed | "client-facing", "deploy", "prototype", "fast delivery", "field" |
| AI Transformation | "change management", "adoption", "enablement", "transformation" |

After detecting archetype, read `modes/_profile.md` for the user's specific framing and proof points for that archetype.
Frame profile as **"Design leader with founder credibility"** — rare combination that adapts by role:
- For Design Leadership: "scaled a design function from 2→10 while shipping AI features that drove 63% YoY growth"
- For AI Product: "founded and exited an AI SaaS — knows how to go from 0 to PMF to acquisition"
- For Design Engineering: "straddles design and code — React, TS, design systems — ships production AI products"
- For Transformation: "ran the AI transformation at Bark.com, trained non-technical stakeholders, built the measurement framework"

The differentiator is not "also has AI skills" — it's "built and sold an AI company while leading design at scale." Very few candidates have both sides of this.

### Portfolio as Proof Point (use in high-value applications)

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] If you have a live demo, dashboard, or public project, configure it here.
     Example:
     dashboard:
       url: "https://yoursite.dev/demo"
       password: "demo-2026"
       when_to_share: "LLMOps, AI Platform, observability roles"
     Read from config/profile.yml → narrative.proof_points and narrative.dashboard -->

If the candidate has a live demo/dashboard (check profile.yml), offer access in applications for relevant roles.

### Comp Intelligence

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Research comp ranges for YOUR target roles and update these ranges -->

**General guidance:**
- Use WebSearch for current market data (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind)
- Frame by role title, not by skills -- titles determine comp bands
- Contractor rates are typically 30-50% higher than employee base to account for benefits
- Geographic arbitrage works for remote roles: lower CoL = better net

### Negotiation Scripts

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Adapt these to your situation -->

**Salary expectations (general framework):**
> "Based on market data for this role, I'm targeting [RANGE from profile.yml]. I'm flexible on structure -- what matters is the total package and the opportunity."

**Geographic discount pushback:**
> "The roles I'm competitive for are output-based, not location-based. My track record doesn't change based on postal code."

**When offered below target:**
> "I'm comparing with opportunities in the [higher range]. I'm drawn to [company] because of [reason]. Can we explore [target]?"

### Location Policy

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Adapt to your situation. Read from config/profile.yml → location -->

**In forms:**
- Binary "can you be on-site?" questions: follow your actual availability from profile.yml
- In free-text fields: specify your timezone overlap and availability

**In evaluations (scoring):**
- Remote dimension for hybrid outside your country: score **3.0** (not 1.0)
- Only score 1.0 if JD explicitly says "must be on-site 4-5 days/week, no exceptions"

### Time-to-offer priority
- Working demo + metrics > perfection
- Apply sooner > learn more
- 80/20 approach, timebox everything

## Global Rules

### NEVER

1. Invent experience or metrics
2. Modify cv.md or portfolio files
3. Submit applications on behalf of the candidate
4. Share phone number in generated messages
5. Recommend comp below market rate
6. Generate a PDF without reading the JD first
7. Use corporate-speak
8. Ignore the tracker (every evaluated offer gets registered)

### ALWAYS

0. **Cover letter:** If the form allows it, ALWAYS include one. Same visual design as CV. JD quotes mapped to proof points. 1 page max.
1. Read cv.md, _profile.md, and article-digest.md (if exists) before evaluating
1b. **First evaluation of each session:** Run `node cv-sync-check.mjs`. If warnings, notify user.
2. Detect the role archetype and adapt framing per _profile.md
3. Cite exact lines from CV when matching
4. Use WebSearch for comp and company data
5. Register in tracker after evaluating
6. Generate content in the language of the JD (EN default)
7. Be direct and actionable -- no fluff
8. Native tech English for generated text. Short sentences, action verbs, no passive voice.
8b. Case study URLs in PDF Professional Summary (recruiter may only read this).
9. **Tracker additions as TSV** -- NEVER edit applications.md directly. Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/`.
10. **Include `**URL:**` in every report header.**

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| WebSearch | Comp research, trends, company culture, LinkedIn contacts, fallback for JDs |
| WebFetch | Fallback for extracting JDs from static pages |
| Playwright | Verify offers (browser_navigate + browser_snapshot). **NEVER 2+ agents with Playwright in parallel.** |
| Read | cv.md, _profile.md, article-digest.md, cv-template.html |
| Write | Temporary HTML for PDF, applications.md, reports .md |
| Edit | Update tracker |
| Canva MCP | Optional visual CV generation. Duplicate base design, edit text, export PDF. Requires `canva_resume_design_id` in profile.yml. |
| Bash | `node generate-pdf.mjs` |

### Time-to-offer priority
- Working demo + metrics > perfection
- Apply sooner > learn more
- 80/20 approach, timebox everything

## Professional Writing & ATS Compatibility

These rules apply to ALL generated text that ends up in candidate-facing documents: PDF summaries, bullets, cover letters, form answers, LinkedIn messages. They do NOT apply to internal evaluation reports.

### Avoid cliché phrases
- "passionate about" / "results-oriented" / "proven track record"
- "leveraged" (use "used" or name the tool)
- "spearheaded" (use "led" or "ran")
- "facilitated" (use "ran" or "set up")
- "synergies" / "robust" / "seamless" / "cutting-edge" / "innovative"
- "in today's fast-paced world"
- "demonstrated ability to" / "best practices" (name the practice)

### Unicode normalization for ATS
`generate-pdf.mjs` automatically normalizes em-dashes, smart quotes, and zero-width characters to ASCII equivalents for maximum ATS compatibility. But avoid generating them in the first place.

### Vary sentence structure
- Don't start every bullet with the same verb
- Mix sentence lengths (short. Then longer with context. Short again.)
- Don't always use "X, Y, and Z" — sometimes two items, sometimes four

### Prefer specifics over abstractions
- "Cut p95 latency from 2.1s to 380ms" beats "improved performance"
- "Postgres + pgvector for retrieval over 12k docs" beats "designed scalable RAG architecture"
- Name tools, projects, and customers when allowed
